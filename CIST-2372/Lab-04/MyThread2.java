 *      Summer 2018 
 *      Assignment #4 part 3
 *
 * 1.)	Write an Application that extends the Thread class, call it 
 * MyThread.java.  Have your new class accept an integer(i.e. 200) when 
 * it is instantiated.  (MyThread mt = new MyThread(200); )
 * This integer number will be the number of times that this class loops 
 * and prints a message.  The message should read "thread Running-200
 * The 200 would be whatever number is passed into the constructor.
 * If the number was 300, then output should read â€œ Thread Running-300
 * Use a main method to test this class.  In the main start 2 Threads, 
 * one Thread with 250 and one Thread with 300.  What happens?  
 * You do not need to use the sleep() method for this exercise.

 * 2.)	Modify the above.  Change this class to use the Runnable Interface 
 * instead of the Thread class.  Any difference how the code runs?
 *
 * 3.)	Lastly, have the main method start 4 different threads, all with 
 * different loop counts.  Test the application, what happens?
